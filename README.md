# How to host your Resume on GitHub.

A quick guide on how to use and format a resume online by using:
1. a lightweight markup language(Markdown),
1. a static site generator(Jekyll) and,
1. sharing/hosting it on a distributed version control system(GitHub Pages).

## Why you should consider hosting your resume Online ?

Making a resume in a .pdf or .docx is outdated and tedious. You need tools to quickly update your resume and instead of uploading multiple files you need a short link where your potential employers can view your resume.As Andrew Etter mentions in his book *Modern Technical Writing* that hosting your content on a website gives you the power to fix inaccuracies almost instantly.This document will guide you to accomplish that goal.

## What you need ?
1. An account on [github](https://github.com/)
1. A resume formatted in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

## Let's Get Started.
1. Login on [github Pages](https://github.com/). Andrew Etter mentions that using Distributed version control system like Git have better performance and allows the writer to work on documentation offline. This is perfect as you will not need to be online to edit or make changes to your resume.

1. Create a new repository. 
1. Name your repository **yourusername.github.io**
  >It is important for you to name the repository exactly in that format because github pages allow one domain per account and github pages need to know which repository to       host.
